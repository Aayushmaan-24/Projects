Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning 🏥🧠
This project is a Machine Learning-based Stroke Predictor that analyzes health data to assess the risk of stroke. It uses feature engineering, data preprocessing, and classification models to make accurate predictions.

Features 🚀
✅ Preprocesses medical data (e.g., age, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, etc.)
✅ Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks
✅ Uses SMOTE for handling class imbalance
✅ Evaluates models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
✅ Provides data visualization for better insights

Tech Stack 🛠️
🔹 Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
🔹 Google Colab
🔹 Machine Learning Algorithms
