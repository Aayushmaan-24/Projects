Features:

Preprocesses text data (removal of stopwords, stemming, etc.).
Converts text to numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization.
Trains a Logistic Regression model to classify sentiment.
Provides metrics like accuracy to evaluate the model.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries and Tools:
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical operations
re for text preprocessing
nltk for natural language processing (stopwords and stemming)
sklearn for feature extraction, model building, and evaluation
